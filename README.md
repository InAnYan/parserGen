# Parser generator
Written in Python. Creates parsers in C++.

Highly undone and experimental. An old project.

Don't even remember how it works. But it is an interesting project done completely by myself.

## Features
- BNF-like grammar input.
- Generates code in different styles.
- Generates AST-like parsing nodes.

## Limitations
- Everything.
- Left recursion.
